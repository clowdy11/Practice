<h1>HTML DESCRIBES THE ESTRUCTURE OF PAGES</h1>
<p>To describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want to appear on the page.</p>
<p>The HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets - these are called HTML elements. Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags</p>

<h2>Attibutes tell us more about elements!</h2>
<p>Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign</p>

<h3>Some examples:</h3>
<p lang="en">This paragraph is supposed to be in English</p>
<p lang="es">Este párrafo está en español</p>
<p>To do this, we add the attibute "lang" in the opening tag, followed by an equals sign (=) and the language code between quotation marks. For example, to tell the browser that the paragraph is in Spanish we write lang="es" after the HTML element</p>
