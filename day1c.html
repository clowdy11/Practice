<h1>Semantic Markups</h1>
<p>We saw the structural markup, elements that describe both heading and paragraphs and affect the structure of the page. Now it's time to learn about semantic markup which provides extra information to the content of the page</p>
<p><strong>First one.</strong> The use of the element &lt;strong&gt; indicates that its content has strong importance. By default, browser will show the contents inside the &lt;strong&gt; tag in bold.</p>
<p><em>Second one.</em>The &lt;em&gt; element indicates emphasis. By default the content inside will be shown in italic.</p>
<h2>Quotations</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp"><p>The &lt;blockquote&gt; element is used for longer quotes that takes an entire paragraph. Note how the &lt;p&gt; element is still used inside the &lt;blockquote&gt; element. Important. Although browsers tend to indent the content inside the &lt;blockquote&gt; tags, it is important to not use this tag for that intention.</p></blockquote>
<p>The &lt;q&gt; element is used for shorter quotes. It is supposed to put quotation marks around, but yunno <q>Internet Explorer</q> doesn't... So many people avoid the use of this tag.</p>
<p><i>Both elements may use the "cite" attribute to indicate where the quote is from. Its valued should be an URL.</i></p>
